# PetAPI
Create a user and log in with verified credentials. Each user can add a new pet with a name and species. A user can view, edit, or delete any of their own pets using an assigned pet ID.

Guest users can view a single pet by ID or a list of all pets sorted by owner or species. Species options are dynamically updated by current pets in the database.
